I made the bc_2010_receptorfreq.csv file by using the Paste to Clipboard instructions here:

http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/WebHelp/Copying_Results_to_the_Windows_Clipboard.htm

Then I edited column names, and went into formatting and removed the , separator in Excel before saving as .csv

The bc_2010_receptorfreq_summary.csv file is made by input_prep.R
